# Monitoring, resolving, and reopening your case<a name="monitoring-your-case"></a>

After you create your support case, you can monitor the status of your case in Support Center\. A new case begins in the **Unassigned** state\. When a support agent begins work on a case, the status changes to **Work in Progress**\. The support agent might respond to your case to ask for more information \(**Pending Customer Action**\) or to let you know that the case is being investigated \(**Pending Amazon Action**\)\.

When your case is updated, you receive email with the correspondence and a link to the case in Support Center\. Use the link in the email message to navigate to the support case\. You can't respond to case correspondences by email\. 

**Notes**  
You must sign in to the AWS account that submitted the support case\. If you sign in as an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, you must have the required permissions to view support cases\. For more information, see [Access permissions for AWS Support](accessing-support.md)\.
If you don't respond to the case within a few days, AWS Support resolves the case automatically\.
Support cases that have been in the resolved state for more than 14 days can't be reopened\. If you have a similar issue that is related to the resolved case, you can create a related case\. For more information, see [Creating a related case](#permanently-closed-cases)\.

## Resolving a support case<a name="resolve-a-support-case"></a>

When you're satisfied with the response or your problem is solved, you can resolve the case in Support Center\. 

**To resolve a support case**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. In the upper\-right corner, choose **Support**, and then choose **Support Center**\.

1. Under **Open support cases**, choose the **Subject** of the support case that you want to resolve\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Reply** and in the **Correspondence** section, enter why you're resolving the case, and then choose **Submit**\. For example, you can enter information about how you fixed the issue yourself in case you need this information for future reference\. 

1. Choose **Resolve case**\.

1. In the dialog box, choose **Ok** to resolve the case\.

**Note**

## Reopening a resolved case<a name="reopen-close-cases"></a>

If you're experiencing the same issue again, you can reopen the original case\. Provide details about when the issue occurred again and what troubleshooting steps that you tried\. Include any related case numbers so that the support agent can refer to previous correspondences\.

**Notes**  
You can reopen your support case up to 14 days from when your issue was resolved\. However, you can't reopen a case that has been inactive for more than 14 days\. You can create a new case or a related case\. For more information, see [Creating a related case](#permanently-closed-cases)\.
If you reopen an existing case that has different information than your current issue, the support agent might ask you to create a new case\. 

**To reopen a resolved case**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. In the upper\-right corner, choose **Support**, and then choose **Support Center**\.

1. Choose **View all cases** and then choose the **Subject** or the **Case ID** of the support case that you want to reopen\.

1. Choose **Reopen case**\.

1. Under **Correspondence**, for **Reply**, enter the case details\.

## Creating a related case<a name="permanently-closed-cases"></a>

After 14 days of inactivity, you can't reopen a resolved case\. If you have a similar issue that is related to the resolved case, you can create a related case\. This related case will include a link to the previously resolved case, so that the support agent can review the previous case details and correspondences\. If you're experiencing a different issue, we recommend that you create a new case\.

**To create a related case**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. In the upper\-right corner, choose **Support** and then choose **Support Center**\.

1. Choose **View all cases** and then choose the **Subject** or the **Case ID** of the support case that you want to reopen\.

1. Choose **Reopen case**\.

1. Follow the same steps to create your case\. See [Creating a support case](case-management.md#creating-a-support-case)\.
