# AWS Trusted Advisor<a name="trusted-advisor"></a>

Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers\. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps\. 

If you have a Basic or Developer Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console to access all checks in the Service Limits category and six checks in the Security category\.

If you have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console and the [AWS Support API](Welcome.md) to access all Trusted Advisor checks\. You also can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor the status of Trusted Advisor checks\. For more information, see [Monitoring Trusted Advisor check results with Amazon CloudWatch Events](cloudwatch-events-ta.md)\. 

You can access Trusted Advisor in the AWS Management Console\. For more information about controlling access to the Trusted Advisor console, see [Manage access for AWS Trusted Advisor](security-trusted-advisor.md)\.
