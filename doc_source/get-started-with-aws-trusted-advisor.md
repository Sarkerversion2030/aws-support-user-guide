# Get started with AWS Trusted Advisor<a name="get-started-with-aws-trusted-advisor"></a>

You can access Trusted Advisor from the AWS Management Console\. Use the Trusted Advisor console to review check results for your AWS account and then follow the recommended steps to fix any issues\. For example, Trusted Advisor might recommend that you delete unused resources to reduce your monthly bill, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance\.

You can also use the AWS Support API to perform operations on your Trusted Advisor checks\. For more information, see the [AWS Support API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\.

## Filter your checks<a name="filter-check-results"></a>

On the check category pages, you can specify which check results that you want to view\. For example, you might filter by checks that have detected errors in your account, so that you can investigate urgent issues first\.

If you have checks that evaluate items in your account, such as AWS resources, you can use tag filters to only show items that have the specified tag\.

**To filter your checks**

1. Sign in to the Trusted Advisor console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/trustedadvisor/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/trustedadvisor/home)\.

1. In the navigation pane or the **Trusted Advisor Dashboard** page, choose the check category\.

   + **Action recommended** – List checks that are red and recommend that you take action
   + **Checks with excluded items** – List checks that you specified to exclude items from the check results

1. If you added tags to your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS CloudTrail trails, you can filter your results so that the checks only show items that have the specified tag\.

   For **Filter by tag**, enter a tag key and value and then choose **Apply filter**\.

   For example, this filter uses the *trailtype* key and *allregions* value\.  
![\[Screenshot of the filter tags feature in the Trusted Advisor console.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/images/filter-by-tags.png)

1. In the table for the check, the check results only show items that have the specified tag and value\.

   The following AWS CloudTrail Logging check shows three trails that have the specified *trailtype* key and the *allregions* value\.  
![\[Screenshot of tag results in the Trusted Advisor console for the AWS CloudTrail Logging check.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/images/filter-by-tags-cloudtrail-trails.png)
