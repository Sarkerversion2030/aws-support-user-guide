# Creating a service quota increase<a name="create-service-quota-increase"></a>

To improve the performance of your service, request increases to your service quotas \(formerly referred to as limits\)\.

**Note**  
You can also use the Service Quotas service to request increases directly for your services\. Currently, Service Quotas doesn't support service quotas for all services\. For more information, see [What is Service Quotas?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.
