# Change log for AWS Trusted Advisor checks<a name="aws-trusted-advisor-change-log"></a>

See the following topic for recent changes to Trusted Advisor checks\. 

**Note**  
If you use the Trusted Advisor console or the AWS Support API, checks that were removed won't appear in check results\. If you use any of the removed checks such as specifying the check ID in an AWS Support API operation or your code, you must remove these checks to avoid API call errors\.

For more information about the available checks, see the [AWS Trusted Advisor best practice checklist](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/)\.
