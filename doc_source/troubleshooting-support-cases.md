If you have difficulty when you create or manage your support case, see the following troubleshooting information\.

## I want to reopen a live chat for my case<a name="closed-chat-window-for-existing-case"></a>

You can reply to your existing support case to open another chat window\. For more information, see [Updating an existing support case](monitoring-your-case.md#update-support-cases)\.

## I can't connect to a live chat<a name="connection-issues-with-chat"></a>

If you chose the **Chat** option but you can't connect to the chat window, first perform the following checks:
+ Ensure that you've configured your browser to allow pop\-up windows in Support Center\.
**Note**  
Review the settings for your browser\. For more information, see the [Chrome Help](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95472?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Callow-pop-ups-and-redirects-from-a-site) and [Firefox Support](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting) websites\.
+ Ensure that you've configured your network so that you can use AWS Support:
  + Your network can access the `*.connect.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` endpoint\.
**Note**  
For AWS GovCloud \(US\), the endpoint is `*.connect-fips.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`\.
  + Your firewall supports web socket connections\.
  + For more information, see [Set up your network](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/ccp-networking.html) in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*\.

If you still can't connect to the chat window, contact your AWS account administrator\.
