| Help us improve the AWS Support App in Slack\. To share your feedback, complete this [short survey](https://amazonintna.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_578jlAGQ2PNewce)\. | 

You can use the AWS Support App to manage your AWS support cases in Slack\. You can invite your team members to chat channels, respond to case updates, and chat directly with support agents\. The AWS Support App helps you manage support cases quickly and directly in Slack\.

You can use the AWS Support App to do the following:
+ Create, update, search for, and resolve support cases in Slack channels
+ Attach files to support cases
+ Request quota increases from Service Quotas
+ Share support case details with your team without leaving the Slack channel
+ Start a live chat session with support agents

When you create, update, or resolve a support case in the AWS Support App the case is also updated in the AWS Support Center Console\. You don't need to sign in to the Support Center Console to manage your support cases separately\.

**Notes**  
The response times for support cases are the same, whether you created the case from Slack or from the Support Center Console\.
You can create a support case for account and billing support, service quota increases, and technical support\. Currently, you can't start a live chat with support agents for account and billing support\.
Currently, AWS Support App in Slack offers only English support\.
